        <h4>2. Netzee Service</h4>

        <p>
          These Terms of Service apply to all users of the Netzee Service.
          Information provided by our users through the Netzee Service may
          contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled

          and agree that Netzee shall not be responsible for any damages,
          claims, or other liability arising from or related to your use of any
          third-party website.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Netzee Access</h4>

          </li>
          <li>
            You will not duplicate, transfer, give access to, copy or distribute

            You will otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of these
            Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>B.</strong> In order to access and use the features of the
          Service
        </p>

        <p>
          You acknowledge and agree that you will have to provide Netzee with

          You must notify Netzee immediately of any breach of security or
          unauthorized use of your mobile phone. Although Netzee will not be

          mswebstress, httpload, blitz, Xcode Automator, Android Monkey, etc.,
          that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages
          to the Netzee servers in a given period of time than a human can
          reasonably produce in the same period by using a Netzee application,
          and you are forbidden from ripping the content unless specifically
          allowed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, Netzee grants the operators of public
          search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the

          efforts to reverse-engineer our system, our protocols, or explore
          outside the boundaries of the normal requests made by Netzee clients.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have to disallow using request modification tools such as fiddler
          or whisker, or the like or any other such tools activities that are
          meant to explore or harm, penetrate or test the site. You must secure
          our permission before you measure, test, health check or otherwise
          monitor any network equipment, servers or assets hosted on our domain.
        </p>

        <p>
          You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable
          information, including the phone number, from the Service, nor to use
          the communication systems provided by the Service for any commercial
          solicitation or spam purposes. You agree not to spam, or solicit for
          commercial purposes, any users of the Service.
